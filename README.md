# Template-Matching
This project is based on the idea of finding a particular feature which occurs multiple times in an input image.
The feature that we want to find is known as template and the image in which we want that feature is known as input image.
The library that is used is openCV.
The method that is used is TM_CCOEFF_NORMED
It returns the coefficient of matching of a particular patch of input image with template.
It is used to find the indices of highest match.
This is where make the rectangles.
